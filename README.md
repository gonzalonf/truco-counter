# Truco Counter

Simple Progressive Web App (PWA) for keeping scores on [Argentinian Truco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truco) matches.

Try the app [here](https://truco-counter.vercel.app/)!

You can also install it (either on your mobile or a PC).

Views are optimized for mobile experience.

This is a working app, but intended as a POC to practice:

- PWA
- D3
- Tailwind
- React Testing Library
