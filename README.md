<!--
TODO:
- Adjust styles (dynamic height and responsive sizes)
- Settings: change language, volume control
- Prevent wide screen on mobile (rotate)
- Undo & Redo (time travel)
- Look & feel / UX: fonts, chalk texture, better icon, better sounds?

MAYBE/LATER:
- More settings => clear all data, game size (15 and 30), plural/singular, custom labels
- Change name labels
- BUTTON (upside - and + controls) "Add n" => toggle modal with input and some options (falta envido, real envido, etc... concatenables)
- Dark mode
